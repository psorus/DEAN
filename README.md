# DEAN
## Deep Ensemble Anomaly Detection


- Use "python3 dean.py" to train t ensembles with different hyperparameter values and find the tuned ensemble with best roc_auc_score.

- Change loaddata.py to load a different dataset.

- the best hyperparameters and roc_auc_score so far are saved in best_auc_score.json







Notice that this code does not include the autoencoder used in the original paper.

The current version of the original paper is given in DEAN.pdf
