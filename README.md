Deep Ensemble Anomaly Detection


Use "python3 main.py" to train an ensemble according to the attributes in hyper.json.
Change loaddata.py to load a different dataset, and use "python3 merge.py" to combine all trained submodels into one ensemble score

Notice that this code does not include the autoencoder used in the original paper

The current version of the original paper is given in DEAN.pdf
